## Description
A demonstration of how 'promises' work using a coin flip and 'Uber' for the example.
  
## Installation Requirements
inquirer@8.2.4
  
## Application Usage
Use this application by reviewing the code and run the command line to visually see how a promise works. Promises are dependent on much more than a coin flip, but for this examples purposes we leave it to chance!
